    "This code works because the __name__ variable in Python scripts is automatically set to the name of the module. If the module is being run from the command line, the __name__ variable will be __main__ by default. Checking the __name__ variable allows us to tell whether a script is running from the command line or not.\n",

    "## The PATH Variable ##\n",

We can run any program in any one of these folders just by typing the program's name. Because /usr/bin is one of the folders in PATH and python is in that folder, we can access the python interpreter just by typing python, instead of the full path.\n",
