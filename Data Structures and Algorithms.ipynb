    "\n",
    "With multiple algorithms to choose from, a programmer has to make trade-offs and decide which algorithm best suits his or her needs. The most common factor to consider is time complexity.\n",
    "Time complexity is a measurement of how much time an algorithm takes with respect to its input size. Algorithms with smaller time complexities generally take less time and are more desirable.\n",
    "\n",
    "When discussing time complexity, we should use the proper notation. Most commonly, we use **Big-O Notation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- To denote constant time, we would write O(1), because 1 is a constant (and a simple constant).\n",
    "- To denote linear time, we would write O(n), because n is the simplest example of linearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Big-O Notation follows a similar pattern for other time complexities. For example, O(n^2), O(2^n), and O(log(n)) are all valid notation. The algorithms with these complexities are probably rather complicated, and we don't need to worry about them at the moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithms with lower-order time complexities are more efficient. Constant time algorithms, which we denote with O(1), are more efficient than linear time algorithms, which we denote with O(n). Similarly, an algorithm with complexity O(n^2) is more efficient than one with complexity O(n^3).\n"

    "## Binary Search\n",
    "This is the strategy a binary search uses. A binary search can help us find an item in a list efficiently if we know the list is ordered. We can check the middle element of the list, compare it to the item we're looking for, and continue narrowing our search in this manner. So if binary search is more efficient than linear search, why ever bother with linear search at all?\n",
    "The answer is that we can only perform a binary search on ordered data. \n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that binary search runs in logarithmic time, which we denote as O(log(n)). Logarithms are the mathematical counterpart to exponents. It makes sense that an algorithm that cuts its problem size in half (or by any fraction) with each iteration will be logarithmic. Here's a graph of constant, linear, and logarithmic time:\n",
    "ï¿¼\n",
    "The graph shows the runtimes of three algorithms with respect to input size. The constant time algorithm is green, linear time is red, and logarithmic time is blue. You can see that the logarithmic function grows more slowly than the linear function over the long run, but still more quickly than the constant function.\n",
