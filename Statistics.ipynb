    "You can still average items on discrete scales, though. You could say \"1.75 cars use this parking lot each day, on average.\" Any daily value for number of cars, however, would need to be a whole number\n",

    "\n",
    "* Equal Interval Scales Equal interval scales are always consistent.  No matter what speed you're traveling at, a difference of five miles per hour is always five miles per hour. The difference between 60 and 55 miles per hour will always be equal to the difference between 10 and five miles per hour.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Logarithmic Scales Each step on a logarithmic scale represents a different order of magnitude. The Richter scale that measures the strength of earthquakes, for example, is a logarithmic scale.\n",

    "* Ordinal scales where items are ordered by rank. how many cigarettes they smoke per day, and the answers could be \"none,\" \"a few,\" \"some,\" or \"a lot.\" These answers don't map exactly to numbers of cigarettes, but we know that \"a few\" is more than \"none.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* Categorical scales Group values into general categories. One example is gender, which can be male or female. Unlike ordinal scales, categorical scales don't have an order. In our gender example, for instance, one category isn't greater than or less than the other.\n",
